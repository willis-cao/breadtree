# Breadtree: Learning Languages by Reading

## Project Proposal
Reading books (or short stories, newspapers, etc.,
henceforth referred to as "books" for simplicity)
written in a language is a fun and effective way to learn
new vocabulary, grammar, and cultural perspectives in their
natural contexts. This strategy is generally used by intermediate and
advanced learners of a language with adequate reading comprehension
skills.

**Breadtree is a notebook application that aims to provide an interface
for the user to record, relate, and consolidate new
vocabulary/grammar/concepts (henceforth referred to as "words") as the user reads**. 
Users will be able to create separate notebooks for each book they read in which they
can add words and their definitions. Users will then be able to review the words
in one or more notebooks through flashcards (to be implemented in the future).


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to make a notebook representing a book.
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple words and their definitions to a notebook.
- As a user, I want to be able to assign categorical tags to words.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of each word, it's definition, and its tags
in a notebook.
- (P2) As a user, I want to be able to save my notebooks to file.
- (P2) As a user, I want to be able to load all of my notebooks from file.

## Instructions for Grader
- You can generate the first required event related to adding notebooks to your list of
notebooks by clicking "New" at the bottom left. Then, enter the name of the new notebook
in the prompt that appears. The new notebook should now be displayed in the tree on the
left where you can now select it.
- You can generate the second required event related to adding words and their definitions
to a notebook by first selecting one of the notebooks in the tree to the left. Then, type in
the text box at the bottom of the application in the format "word, definition, tag1, tag2, etc..."
and press the Enter key to add it to the currently displayed notebook.
- There are two visual components, the tree on the left displaying the list of notebooks
and the tags found in each one, as well as the table on the right displaying the entries
contained in the selected notebook.
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the "Save" button at the bottom left.
- When the application is opened, it automatically loads the saved state.
