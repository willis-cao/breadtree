# Breadtree: Learning Languages by Reading

## Project Proposal
Reading books, short stories, newspapers, and other material
written in a language is a fun and effective way to learn
new vocabulary, grammar, and cultural perspectives in their
natural contexts. This strategy is generally used by intermediate and
advanced learners of a language with adequate reading comprehension
skills.

**Breadtree is an application that aims to provide an interface
for the user to record, relate, and consolidate new
vocabulary/grammar/concepts as the user reads**. Repeated exposure
is known to improve memory and recall--language learners often
take advantage of this using flashcards. Despite being very
effective, flashcards have a few drawbacks. First, vocabulary/grammar/concepts
generally exist as independent entities (cards). Second, flashcard
reviewing is often tedious. In a video by
YouTuber Matt vs Japan (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3sqHvdpBwM),
Matt describes how flashcards demand significant daily time
investment, especially in the later stages of learning.
While flashcards may be one of the most effective and fast ways 
to memorize vocabulary and grammar, there is an argument that the time 
spent reviewing cards would be better spent reading books, short stories,
or the news.
