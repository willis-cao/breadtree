# Breadtree: Learning Languages by Reading

## Project Proposal
Reading books (or short stories, newspapers, etc.,
henceforth referred to as "books" for simplicity)
written in a language is a fun and effective way to learn
new vocabulary, grammar, and cultural perspectives in their
natural contexts. This strategy is generally used by intermediate and
advanced learners of a language with adequate reading comprehension
skills.

**Breadtree is a notebook application that aims to provide an interface
for the user to record, relate, and consolidate new
vocabulary/grammar/concepts (henceforth referred to as "words") as the user reads**. 
Users will be able to create separate notebooks for each book they read in which they
can add words and their definitions. Users will then be able to review the words
in one or more notebooks through flashcards (to be implemented).


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to make a notebook representing a book.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new word and its definition to a notebook.
- As a user, I want to be able to assign categorical tags to words.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of each word, it's definition, and its tags
in a notebook.
